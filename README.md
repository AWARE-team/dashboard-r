# dashboard-r
An R Shiny Dashboard client for visualising data in an AWARE-compatible MySQL database.

At the moment, you need to hardcode the details of your mysql server, in the beginning of the file "server.R"

To run, open "global.R" in R Studio, and click the "Run App" button. It should download the necessary packages automatically, and launch the app.
